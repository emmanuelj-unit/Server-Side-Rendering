How To Master Server-Side Rendering with Next.js on Ubuntu

Introduction
- Brief overview of Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Importance of SSR in modern web development
- Benefits of using Next.js for SSR

1. Install
- Install Ubuntu on your development environment (if not already set up)
- Install Node.js and npm on Ubuntu
- Verify the installation

2. Create
- Create a new Next.js project
- Start the development server
 
3. Configure
- Configure your Next.js project for SSR
  - Create a server-side rendered page in the `pages` directory

4. Integrate
- Integrate additional features such as API routes, dynamic routing, and middleware as needed for your application.

5. Deploy
- Prepare your application for deployment
- Deploy your Next.js application on a cloud service or VPS
  - Configure Nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy for your Next.js app (for this project i used Nginx)
  - Set up your domain and SSL certificate

6. Monitor
- Set up monitoring tools to keep track of your application's performance and availability
  - Use tools like Datadog, PM2, New or Relic for monitoring (for this project i used datadog)
 
7. Test
- Perform thorough testing to ensure your SSR implementation works correctly
  - Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
  - Use tools like Jest

8. Secure
- Implement security best practices to protect your application
  - Use HTTPS, set security headers, and sanitize user inputs
  - Implement authentication and authorization

9. Automate
- Automate your development and deployment processes using CI/CD pipelines
  - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
  - Use Docker for containerization

10. Troubleshoot
- Common issues and troubleshooting tips for SSR with Next.js on Ubuntu
  - Debugging server-side code
  - Handling deployment issues
  - Optimizing performance and resolving bottlenecks
